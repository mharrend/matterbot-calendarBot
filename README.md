# matterbot-calendarBot
Calendar Bot for mattermost

## Requirements
This bot is making use of
* Mattermost http://www.mattermost.org
* Exchangelib https://github.com/ecederstrand/exchangelib/tree/master/exchangelib
* Matterhook https://github.com/numberly/matterhook
* Mattermost_bot https://github.com/LPgenerator/mattermost_bot

## Purpose
* The calendarBot can be used to display events from an Microsoft Exchange 2007-2016 Server or Office365 account in Mattermost.
  * By using the category field of an event it is possible to which Mattermost group an event is posted.
  * If the Mattermost group cannot be found, a default channel is used.
  * A global setting exists to define in which time in advance an event is posted in Mattermost.
  * By default events are deleted for now after they have been posted to Mattermost. In the future, most likely an option will allow to just mask these events.
* Furthermore, a plugin for the Mattermost_bot bot exists, which allows to create events in Mattermost itself. Have a look at https://github.com/mharrend/matterbot-plugins-server/blob/master/calendar.py
  * Using this plugin events and subcalendars can be created.
  * The events and calendars are stored in the online account and also saved in a local SQLite database.
  * The plugin also allows to show the agenda of today using all subcalendars or specifying only one subcalendar.
